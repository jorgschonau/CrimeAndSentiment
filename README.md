# Final Project - Crime & Sentiment

Everything for the final project for the Ubiqum bootcamp will go here.

In this project I created a sentiment analysis of a number of classic books (currently Crime & Punishment, Charlie and Chocolate Factory, 1984 & Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), also included is a visualisation using Tableau and / or Shiny.

You'll find the entire project on http://www.databarcelona.com/sentiments.html.

Here's a preview of the visualisation using Tableau:
